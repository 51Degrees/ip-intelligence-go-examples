# Example Performance

The example illustrates a "clock-time" benchmark for assessing detection speed.

You must set the next ENV parameter before run:

`DATA_FILE=/path/to/file/51Degrees-IpiV41.ipi`


Example of output to file:

`
Average 0.10825 ms per Evidence Record
Average 9237.88 detections per second
Total Evidence Records: 20000
Iteration Count: 5
Processed Evidence Records: 100000
Number of CPUs: 14
