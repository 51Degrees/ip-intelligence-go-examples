# Example OfflineProcessing

Getting started example of using 51Degrees IP intelligence integrated to Golang.

This example demonstrates one possible use of the 51Degrees on-premise IP intelligence
API and data for offline data processing. It also demonstrates that you can reuse the
retrieved results for multiple uses and only then release it.

You must set the next ENV parameter before run:

`DATA_FILE=/path/to/file/51Degrees-IpiV41.ipi`
