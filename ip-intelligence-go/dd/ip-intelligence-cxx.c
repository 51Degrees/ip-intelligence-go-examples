/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesCache Cache
 *
 * Fixed size, thread safe, loading, tree based cache.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Implements a fixed size, thread safe, loading, tree based cache. Items
 * requested which are not in the cache already are loaded using the specified
 * load method, before returning as with items which are already in the cache.
 *
 * Items are fetched from the cache using the #fiftyoneDegreesCacheGet method
 * and the item is prevented from being expelled from the cache until the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesCacheRelease method is called. Failure to release cache
 * items once they are finished with will result in the available nodes in the
 * cache being exhausted (i.e. no new items can be loaded into the cache).
 *
 * As the cache is fixed size, the size must be set correctly in order to
 * prevent failures in the get method. The size of a cache **MUST** be equal to
 * or greater than the maximum number of items which will be in use
 * simultaneously across all threads. Fetching more items than the cache was
 * created to expect will result in the same failure as not releasing items.
 *
 * The cache is sharded based on the modulo of the key to improve performance
 * in multi threaded operation where an even distribution of key modulos are
 * present.
 *
 * Details of the red black tree implementation can be found in tree.c.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```
 * byte *data;
 * fiftyoneDegreesCacheLoadMethod *methodToLoadEntryFromData;
 *
 * // Create a cache
 * fiftyoneDegreesCache cache = fiftyoneDegreesCacheCreate(
 *      100,
 *      1,
 *      methodToLoadEntryFromData,
 *      fiftyoneDegreesCacheHash64,
 *      data);
 *
 * // Get an item from the cache
 * fiftyoneDegreesCacheNode *entry = fiftyoneDegreesCacheGet(
 *     cache,
 *     &0,
 *     exception);
 *
 * // Check that the value was found
 * if (entry != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Get the value from the entry
 *     int *value = (int*)entry->data.ptr;
 *
 *     // Do something with the value
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // Release the entry back to the cache
 *     fiftyoneDegreesCacheRelease(entry);
 * }
 *
 * // Free the cache
 * fiftyoneDegreesCacheFree(cache);

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesData Data
 *
 * Structure containing memory allocated to store a variable.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Data** : a structure containing memory allocated to a certain item. This
 * can be of any type.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Data structure contains memory allocated for the purpose of storing a
 * variable. This differs from a direct pointer in that the memory can be
 * reused for another purpose. By keeping track of how much data has been
 * allocated, the same allocation can be reused if memory of equal or smaller
 * size is needed, otherwise more memory can be automatically allocated in the
 * same method call.
 *
 * ## Creation
 * 
 * A Data structure does not need to be created by a method, it only needs to
 * be allocated in memory. However, it does need to be reset before any
 * operations are carried out with it.
 *
 * ## Allocation
 *
 * To allocate memory for a variable in a Data structure, the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesDataMalloc method can be called in a similar way to the
 * standard malloc method. Any existing variable in the Data structure will
 * either be overwritten by the new variable, or the previous variable will be
 * freed and new memory allocated.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```
 * // Allocate a data structure
 * fiftyoneDegreesData *data = Malloc(sizeof(fiftyoneDegreesData));
 *
 * // Reset the data ready to allocate something
 * fiftyoneDegreesDataReset(data);
 *
 * // Create the data to store
 * const char *string = "some data";
 * size_t size = strlen(string) * sizeof(char);
 *
 * // Allocate the memory inside the data structure
 * void *dataPtr = fiftyoneDegreesDataMalloc(data, size);
 *
 * // Check the allocation was succesful
 * if (dataPtr != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Set the data in the data structure and size it uses
 *     strcpy((char*)dataPtr, string);
 *     data->used = size;
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesExceptions Exceptions
 *
 * Allow the bubbling up or errors in C.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * An exception structure is used to allow the bubbling up of errors, as C
 * does not support exceptions in that way. This means that instead of an error
 * causing a segmentation fault elsewhere, the exception is set and passed all
 * the way up to be checked.
 *
 * ## Creating
 * 
 * Exceptions are created by the caller using the
 * #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE macro which creates an exception pointer
 * named "exception". This is then passed into any method which can potentially
 * throw an exception.
 *
 * ## Checking
 *
 * An exception can be checked using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_OKAY macro
 * which will return true if there is no exception, or false if an exception
 * has occurred.
 *
 * ## Throwing
 *
 * In the event that an exception has occurred in a method, it can be checked
 * and thrown using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_THROW macro. If the
 * exception is okay, then nothing will be thrown by this macro, so it is safe
 * to call as a "catch and throw" method. This will behave differently
 * depending on whether it is used in the context of C or C++.
 *
 * **C** : C does not support exceptions, so if there is an exception, the
 * exception message will be printed to standard output, then the process will
 * exit.
 *
 * **C++** : As C++ supports exceptions, a fatal exception with the message
 * will be thrown. This can then be caught or handled in whichever way the
 * caller sees fit.
 *
 * ## Messages
 *
 * The error message returned by an exception consists of the error message
 * itself, the name of the source file which caused the error, the name of the
 * function which caused the error and the line in the source file at which the
 * error occurred.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * // Create an exception
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * // Set the exception a failure status
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_SET(FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_NULL_POINTER);
 * // Check the exception
 * if  (FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_FAILED) {
 *     // Throw the exception
 *     FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_THROW;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disabling
 *
 * To improve performance, exception handling can be disabled completely by
 * compiling with FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTIONS_DISABLED. This changes all the
 * macro calls to do nothing, meaning that no checks occur, and no exceptions
 * are thrown.
 *

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesStatus Status
 *
 * Status codes and messages indicating the result of an operation.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A status code is an enum indicating the result of an operation, usually
 * the initialisation of something. If the status is anything other than
 * #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS, then the operation was not successful. In
 * that case, the status code indicates the nature of the failure. 
 *
 * A status code can be returned by any method that wishes to report a specific
 * error rather than just returning `NULL`.
 *
 * Examples of error status codes are `insufficient memory` or `corrupt data`.
 * If an operation was successful then this is reported in the same way by
 * returning a `success` status code.
 *
 * Status codes have related messages which can be fetched using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesStatusGetMessage method. The messages are intended to be
 * useful messages which are returned to the user in the event of an error
 * occurring.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * const char *fileName;
 * fiftyoneDegreesStatusCode status;
 *
 * // Check whether the result of an operation was successful
 * if (status != FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *
 *     // Get the status message as the operation has not succeeded
 *     const char *message = fiftyoneDegreesStatusGetMessage(status, fileName);
 *
 *     // Do something with the message
 *     // ...

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesTree Tree
 *
 * Implementation of the classic red black binary tree.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Implementation of a classic red black binary tree adapted to support the
 * result set structure used in the LRU cache. Several important considerations
 * should be noted with this implementation.
 *
 * 1. The maximum number of entries in the tree is known when the tree is
 *    created. All memory allocation is performed at initialisation.
 * 2. Once the tree is full it will remain full and never shrinks. The memory
 *    used is freed when the cache is freed.
 * 3. A node in the tree also contains other data such as the linked list
 *    pointers used to identify the first and last entry in the cache, and
 *    the cache data itself. See structure Node.
 * 4. The cache structure Cache contains special fields "empty"
 *    and "root". "Empty" is used in place of NULL to indicate that the left,
 *    right or parent pointer of the node has no data. The use of "empty" makes
 *    the algorithm more efficient as the data structure used to indicate no
 *    data is the same as a valid data structure and therefore does not require
 *    custom logic. The "root" fields left pointer is used as the start of the
 *    tree. Similarly the parent element being a valid data structure
 *    simplifies the algorithm.
 *
 * Developers modifying this section of code should be familiar with the red
 * black tree design template. Code comments assume an understanding of the
 * principles involved.
 *
 * For further information see:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree

 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesCollection Collection
 *
 * Group of related items such as strings.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Collection** : a group of items that share a common data structure.
 *
 * **Item** : an immutable entity within the collection. The number of bytes
 * used to store the item may be either fixed or variable.
 *
 * **Get** : returns an immutable Item that must be released when the caller is
 * finished with it.
 *
 * **Release** : releases a lock on the Item returned from the Get operation.
 *
 * **Index** : where the Item data uses a fixed number of bytes the index of
 * the item in the Collection.
 *
 * **Offset** : where items do not share the same number of data bytes the 0
 * based offset to the Item from the start of the collection’s data (after any
 * header).
 * 
 * ## Introduction
 * 
 * A Collection is a group of related Items such as strings or properties where 
 * the consumer wishes to access the items without concern for the underlying 
 * storage mechanism and memory management. Immutable items can be retrieved 
 * (Get) from the collection which **MUST** be released once the caller has
 * finished with the data.
 * 
 * In some configurations it may be more efficient to load all related Items
 * into memory in a continuous address space exactly matching the data structure
 * used in the source data. In others it may be desirable to only load in memory
 * the Items from the source data when required. In all configurations the 
 * logical methods to retrieve and release these items are identical.
 * 
 * The methods in the Collection abstract the implementation for collection of 
 * items to support the following configurations:
 * 
 * **Memory** : all the Items in the Collection are held in a continuous
 * address  space. The fastest access option where all memory can be allocated
 * during initialisation.
 * 
 * **File** : none of the Items are loaded into memory and they are retrieved
 * from the data source when required. The slowest access option but the most
 * memory efficient. The memory needed to store the item is allocated when the
 * Item is requested and deallocated when released.
 * 
 * **Cache** : a hybrid mode where the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is used
 * to store a limited number of Items in memory. Cache is a compromise between
 * in memory and file based configurations. Unlike Memory and File the cache
 * needs to be locked when accessed for both Get and Release and performance
 * may degrade when used in a multi threaded configuration.
 * 
 * Sometimes it may be desirable to use multiple configurations of Collection
 * with the same underlying data. Consider a data structure where the most 
 * frequently required Items exist at the start of the structure. These Items
 * would benefit from being held in memory for fast retrieval whilst the
 * remaining Items which may be infrequently required are cached or loaded when 
 * needed from the file. For these situations Collections can be chained
 * together such that the first Collection may not contain data for the
 * requested index or offset and can pass the retrieval to the next Collection
 * in the chain. It is important to note that all chained Collections must be a
 * subset of the final Collection in the chain (as opposed to additional 
 * Collections), i.e. all elements are 'gettable' from the final Collection.
 * 
 * Once a Collection is created the only methods that should be used to access 
 * data are those exposed in the fiftyoneDegreesCollection instance. It is for 
 * this reason the collection.h file exposes so few external methods.
 * 
 * ## Creation
 * 
 * There are two Collection creation methods:

 * ### #fiftyoneDegreesCollectionCreateFromMemory  
 * 
 * Creates a Collection that is created to access memory that is already
 * allocated in continuous memory simply maps to this memory and provides 
 * relatively simple methods to retrieve Items. No reference to the underlying 
 * data file or source is required but the memory must already be allocated.
 * 
 * ### #fiftyoneDegreesCollectionCreateFromFile 
 * 
 * A Collection mapped to a data file is more complex than the memory method
 * and a greater set of creation configuration features are required. For
 * example; caching options or how many Items at the start of the Collection to
 * store in memory.
 * 
 * A #fiftyoneDegreesCollectionConfig structure is used to configure the 
 * operation of the resulting Collection. This structure has the following 
 * fields.
 * 
 * **loaded** : the number of Items to load into memory from the start of the
 * Collection’s data structure.
 *
 * **capacity** : 0 if a cache should not be used, otherwise the capacity of
 * cache.

 * **concurrency** : the expected number of concurrent operations, 1 or greater.
 * 
 * The file create method will work out the different types of Collection(s)
 * needed and how to chain them based on the configuration provided.
 * 
 * Additionally, a pointer to a method to read an Item into the Collection from 
 * the underlying data file is required. For fixed width Collections the 
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionReadFileFixed can be used where the Item key is the
 * zero based index in the Collection. For variable byte width Collections the
 * consumer will need to provide a method that implements
 * #fiftyoneDegreesCollectionFileRead. 
 * 
 * All creation methods return a pointer to an instance of 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesCollection. Following creation only the methods exposed by 
 * this Collection should be used to retrieve and release Items.
 * 
 * ## Free
 * 
 * The freeCollection method of the Collection must be called when the
 * Collection is finished with. After this method is called the Collection data
 * structure and all owned data will be released.
 * 
 * ## Get & Release
 * 
 * All operations that retrieve data from the Collection require an instance of
 * #fiftyoneDegreesCollectionItem to be passed. Items can be reused across
 * multiple Get and Release operations to reduce the frequency of memory
 * allocations. Items contain a handle to the underlying data which might be
 * used during the Release operation.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * FILE *file;
 * fiftyoneDegreesFilePool *filePool;
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * const fiftyoneDegreesCollectionConfig *config;
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionItem item;
 *
 * // Read the collection header from file which contains 32 bit integers
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionHeader *header = fiftyoneDegreesCollectionHeaderFromFile(
 *     file,
 *     sizeof(int32_t),
 *     true);
 *
 * // Create the collection from a file which contains 32 bit integers
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollection *collection = fiftyoneDegreesCollectionCreateFromFile(
 *     file,
 *     filePool,
 *     config,
 *     header,
 *     fiftyoneDegreesCollectionGetInteger32);
 *
 * // Check the collection was create successfully
 * if (collection != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Initialise the item ready to store data from the collection
 *     fiftyoneDegreesDataReset(&item.data);
 *
 *     // Get a pointer to the value from the collection
 *     int32_t *valuePtr = collection->get(
 *         collection,
 *         0,
 *         &item,
 *         exception);
 *
 *     // Check the value was returned
 *     if (valuePtr != NULL) {
 *
 *         // Get the value from the pointer
 *         int32_t value = *valuePtr;
 *
 *         // Release the value back to the collection
 *         FIFTYONE_DEGREES_COLLECTION_RELEASE(collection, &item);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Free the collection
 *     FIFTYONE_DEGREES_COLLECTION_FREE(collection);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Important Considerations
 * 
 * The Item passed to the Get method **MUST** have had
 * #fiftyoneDegreesDataReset called on the data field before use to set the
 * default field values. Without this reset the Collection will not know if it
 * can reuse any memory already allocated from a previous Get operation that is
 * no longer being referenced. For example, if a large string was loaded into
 * an Item, and the Item is then reused for a shorter string, there is no need
 * to reallocate memory. Therefore, the same memory is reused.
 * 
 * The get and release methods of the collection are the only methods that 
 * should be used to retrieve items from a collection. An item retrieved with 
 * the get method **MUST** be released when finished with via a call to the 
 * collection’s release method.
 * 
 * A call to Get **DOES NOT** need to set the Collection field of the Item.
 * Collection is not a mandatory field to avoid the overhead of setting the
 * Collection field where the Collection’s implementation of the Release method
 * does nothing. This is important to avoid a performance penalty when all
 * Collection data is in memory and does not need to be released. For this
 * reason the consumer must always reference the Collection directly and not
 * via the Collection field of the Item. The Collection field is used by 
 * some internal 51Degrees method where a specific Get method is used that will
 * always set the Collection.

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesFile File
 *
 * File handle pool and simple file operations e.g. copy and delete.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Implements a pool of file handles for use within multi-threaded environments
 * where the overhead of opening and closing a file handle for each thread
 * would be too great. Primarily used to load collection items from file with 
 * file based collections or where a cache is used.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * The #fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolInit method is used to initialise a pointer to
 * a #fiftyoneDegreesFilePool. A concurrency value is provided to indicate the
 * maximum number of threads that will be in operation. If this value is lower
 * than the actual number of threads the stack can be exhausted and a null
 * pointer is returned instead of a valid file handle. The concurrency value
 * must always be the same or greater than the number of threads. When compiled
 * in single threaded operation a pool is not strictly required and the
 * implementation maintains a simple stack for consistency of interface and to
 * minimise divergent code.
 *
 * ## Get & Release
 *
 * Handles are retrieved from the pool via the #fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleGet 
 * method. The handle **MUST** be returned with the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleRelease method when it is finished with. The
 * handle will always be open and ready for read only operation. The position
 * of the handle within the source file cannot be assumed. If too many threads
 * are accessing the pool simultaneously, meaning a handle cannot be secured,
 * then a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * The handles are closed when the reader is released via the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolRelease method. Any memory allocated by the 
 * implementation for the stack is freed.
 *
 * ## File Operations
 *
 * Common file operations can also be carried out using the methods defined
 * here. The supported operations are:
 *
 * **copy** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCopy
 *
 * **create directory** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCreateDirectory
 *
 * **create temp file** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCreateTempFile
 *
 * **delete** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileDelete
 *
 * **get existing temp file** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetExistingTempFile
 *
 * **get file name** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetFileName
 *
 * **get path** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetPath
 *
 * **get size** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetSize
 *
 * **open** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileOpen
 *
 * **read to byte array** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileReadToByteArray
 *
 * **write** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileWrite
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * fiftyoneDegreesFilePool pool;
 * const char *fileName;
 *
 * // Initialise a file pool
 * fiftyoneDegreesStatus status = fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolInit(
 *     &filePool,
 *     fileName,
 *     1,
 *     exception);
 *
 * // Check that the pool was initialised successfully
 * if (status == FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *
 *     // Get a file handle from the pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesFileHandle *handle = fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleGet(
 *         &pool,
 *         exception);
 *
 *     // Check that the handle was returned successfully
 *     if (FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_OKAY) {
 *
 *         // Do something with the file pointer in handle->file
 *         // ...
 *
 *         // Release the file handle back to the pool
 *         fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleRelease(handle);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Release the file pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolRelease(&pool);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * To improve performance in multi-threaded operation a non locking stack is 
 * used where a Compare and Swap (CAS) atomic operation is used to pop and push 
 * handles on and off the stack. The design was adapted from the following 
 * article (http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/) which explains some of the 
 * challenges involved including the ABA problem 
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). It is for this reason the head 
 * structure is implemented as a union between the values and the exchange
 * integer. Pointers are not used as the address space for the stack is 
 * continuous and always very small compared to the total addressable memory 
 * space.

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesPool Pool
 *
 * Pool of handles to allow safe access to multiple threads.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Pool structure defines a pool of handles to a resource, and allows a safe
 * way to access them in a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * The #fiftyoneDegreesPoolInit method is used to initialise a pointer to
 * a #fiftyoneDegreesPool. A concurrency value is provided to indicate the
 * maximum number of threads that will be in operation. If this value is lower
 * than the actual number of threads the stack can be exhausted and a null
 * pointer is returned instead of a valid item. The concurrency value must
 * always be the same or greater than the number of threads. When compiled
 * in single threaded operation a pool is not strictly required and the
 * implementation maintains a simple stack for consistency of interface and to
 * minimise divergent code.
 *
 * ## Get & Release
 *
 * Handles are retrieved from the pool via the #fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemGet
 * method. The handle **MUST** be returned with the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemRelease method when it is finished with. The
 * handle will always be open and ready for read only operation. If too many
 * threads are accessing the pool simultaneously, meaning a handle cannot be
 * secured, then a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * The items are closed when the pool is released via the
 *  #fiftyoneDegreesPoolFree method. Any memory allocated by the implementation
 * for the stack is freed.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * void *state;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPoolResourceCreate resourceCreate;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPoolResourceFree resourceFree;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPool pool;
 *
 * // Initialise a pool of resources and check that it was successful
 * if (fiftyoneDegreesPoolInit(
 *     &pool,
 *     1,
 *     state,
 *     resourceCreate,
 *     resourceFree,
 *     exception) != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Get a resource from the pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesPoolItem *item = fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemGet(
 *         &pool,
 *         exception);
 *
 *     // Check that there was a resource available
 *     if (item != NULL) {
 *
 *         // Do something with the resource without being interrupted by other
 *         // threads
 *         // ...
 *
 *         // Release the resource back to the pool
 *         fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemRelease(item);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Free the pool of resources
 *     fiftyoneDegreesPoolFree(&pool);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * To improve performance in multi-threaded operation a non locking stack is 
 * used where a Compare and Swap (CAS) atomic operation is used to pop and push 
 * handles on and off the stack. The design was adapted from the following 
 * article (http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/) which explains some of the 
 * challenges involved including the ABA problem 
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). It is for this reason the head 
 * structure is implemented as a union between the values and the exchange
 * integer. Pointers are not used as the address space for the stack is 
 * continuous and always very small compared to the total addressable memory 
 * space.

#define FIFTYONE_DEGREES_LIST_H_INCLUDED

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesList List
 *
 * A more manageable way to store arrays.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Lists are a way of storing an array of elements in an easy to manage way.
 * This means that the capacity, and the number of elements are both known
 * quantities to any method handling the list, in contrast to a pure array
 * where neither are known.
 * Lists hold collection items, so when they are finished with, they must be
 * freed correctly using the #fiftyoneDegreesListFree method.
 * Cleanup is also handled so as to be simpler to use than an array. By freeing
 * the list, all elements are released from their collection and the memory
 * for the list is freed.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * Lists are created by allocating memory to the list structure, then calling
 * the init method #fiftyoneDegreesListInit to allocate memory for list items
 * and initialise the count and capacity.
 *
 * ## Add
 *
 * Collection items are added to a list using the #fiftyoneDegreesListAdd
 * method. This then holds the reference to the collection item until the list
 * is freed.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * Items can be fetched from the list by accessing the collection item
 * directly:
 * ```
 * list->items[index]
 * ```
 * then casting the pointer it contains to the correct type. Or for strings
 * the #fiftyoneDegreesListGetAsString method can be used to access and cast
 * in one call.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * Lists must be freed using the #fiftyoneDegreesListFree method. This releases
 * all collection items stored within, and frees the memory for the internal
 * array which stores their pointers.
 *
 * ## Reuse
 *
 * Lists can be reused by releasing all the collection items with the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesListRelease method, clearing the list ready for a new list
 * of items to be added.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * fiftyoneDegreesList list;
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionItem *item;
 *
 * // Initialise the list with the capacity for 1 entry
 * fiftyoneDegreesListInit(&list, 1);
 *
 * // Add an item from a collection to the list
 * fiftyoneDegreesListAdd(&list, item);
 *
 * // Get the first item in the list as a string
 * fiftyoneDegreesString *string = fiftyoneDegreesListGetAsString(&list, 0);
 *
 * // Do Something with the string
 * // ...
 *
 * // Free the list, releasing the items it contains back to their respective
 * // collections
 * fiftyoneDegreesListFree(&list);
 * ```
 *

/**

 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesString String
 *
 * String structures containing the string and length.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * The String structure allows a string and its length to be stored in one
 * structure. This avoids unnecessary calls to strlen. Both the string and its
 * length are allocated in a single operation, so the size of the actual
 * structure (when including the string terminator) is
 * sizeof(#fiftyoneDegreesString) + length. This means that the string itself
 * starts at "value" and continues into the rest of the allocated memory.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * Getting a const char * from a #fiftyoneDegreesString structure can be done
 * by casting a reference to the "value" field:
 * ```
 * (const char*)&string->value
 * ```
 * However, this can be simplified by using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STRING macro
 * which also performs a NULL check on the structure to avoid a segmentation
 * fault.
 *
 * ## Compare
 *
 * This file contains two case insensitive string comparison methods as
 * standards like `stricmp` vary across compilers.
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompare** : compares two strings case insensitively
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompareLength** : compares two strings case

 * 
 * When converting from 51Degrees implementation to native float type, if it results

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesString String
 *
 * String structures containing the string and length.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * The String structure allows a string and its length to be stored in one
 * structure. This avoids unnecessary calls to strlen. Both the string and its
 * length are allocated in a single operation, so the size of the actual
 * structure (when including the string terminator) is
 * sizeof(#fiftyoneDegreesString) + length. This means that the string itself
 * starts at "value" and continues into the rest of the allocated memory.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * Getting a const char * from a #fiftyoneDegreesString structure can be done
 * by casting a reference to the "value" field:
 * ```
 * (const char*)&string->value
 * ```
 * However, this can be simplified by using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STRING macro
 * which also performs a NULL check on the structure to avoid a segmentation
 * fault.
 *
 * ## Compare
 *
 * This file contains two case insensitive string comparison methods as
 * standards like `stricmp` vary across compilers.
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompare** : compares two strings case insensitively
 *
 * **fiftyoneDegreesStringCompareLength** : compares two strings case
 * insensitively up to the length required. Any characters after this point are
 * ignored

#define FIFTYONE_DEGREES_HEADERS_H_INCLUDED

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesHeaders Headers
 *
 * Common form of evidence in 51Degrees engines.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * HTTP headers are a common form of evidence, so required headers have their
 * own structure and methods. By storing the unique id of headers, storing
 * duplicates of the same header can be avoided. Duplicates can occur as a
 * result of different cases or prefixes e.g. `User-Agent`, `user-agent` and
 * `HTTP_user-agent` are all the same header.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * A header structure is created using the #fiftyoneDegreesHeadersCreate
 * method. This takes a state and a method used to extract the unique headers
 * from the state. See the method description for more details.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * A header can be fetched using it's unique id with the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesHeadersGetHeaderFromUniqueId method.
 *
 * The index of a header in the unique headers structure can also be fetched
 * using the #fiftyoneDegreesHeaderGetIndex method.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * Once a headers structure is finished with, it is released using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesHeadersFree method.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * fiftyoneDegreesHeadersGetMethod getHeaderId;
 * void *state;
 *
 * // Create the headers structure
 * fiftyoneDegreesHeaders *headers = fiftyoneDegreesHeadersCreate(
 *     false,
 *     state,
 *     getHeaderId,
 *     exception);
 *
 * // Get the index of a header
 * int index = fiftyoneDegreesHeaderGetIndex(
 *     headers,
 *     "user-agent",
 *     strlen("user-agent"));
 *
 * // Check that the header exists in the structure
 * if (index >= 0) {
 *
 *     // Do something with the header
 *     // ...
 * }
 *
 * // Free the headers structure
 * fiftyoneDegreesHeadersFree(headers);
 * ```

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesDataSet Data Set
 *
 * A data file initialised in a structure.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Get** : returns an immutable data set that must be released when the
 * caller is finished with it.

 * **Release** : releases a reference on the data set returned from the Get
 * operation.

 * **Reload** : reloads an existing data set while maintaining any current
 * references to the existing data set.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A DataSet is a data file initialised in a structure that can be used to
 * process data. Collections from the file may be stored in memory or streamed
 * from the file when needed.
 *
 * A DataSet is used to process data, in most cases this is in the form of
 * evidence. Values for the Properties which the data set is capable of
 * returning can then be retrieved from the result of processing.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * A DataSet is created by allocating the structure and initialising from one
 * of the following:
 *
 * **File** : a data file is either read into memory or handle maintained for
 * streaming by the data set.
 *
 * **Memory** : a data file read into continuous memory is used by the data set.
 *
 * ## Operation
 *
 * A DataSet is a resource to be maintained by a Resource Manager. So any
 * thread wanting to use it must get a reference from the manager
 * (see resource.h).
 *
 * The data set implementation extending will contain methods to process data.
 * Usually these will return a Results instance (or an extending structure),
 * see results.h for more details.
 *
 * ## Reloading
 *
 * A DataSet can be reloaded without interrupting operation by using the 
 * defined Reload methods. These take either a new data file or a new memory
 * pointer, initialise a new data set, and replace the existing one in a
 * thread-safe manor.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * A DataSet is a managed resource, so it should not be freed directly. Instead
 * the manager should be freed, so that the data set is safely freed without
 * impacting other threads.

#define FIFTYONE_DEGREES_MANAGER_INCLUDED

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesResource Resource Manager
 *
 * Resources to be managed by a resource manager.
 *
 * ## Terms
 * 
 * **Resource** : a pointer to anything which needs to be replaced or freed in
 * a thread-safe manor
 *
 * **Manager** : manages access to a resource by handing out handles and
 * altering the resource safely
 *
 * **Handle** : a reference to a resource which is being managed. This is the
 * only way in which a resource should be accessed
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Resource is a structure which can be changed or freed at any time, so
 * is managed by a resource manager to allow safe concurrent access. Any
 * resource which is being used will not be changed or freed until the last
 * reference to it has been released.
 *
 * ## Create
 *
 * A resource manager is created by allocating the memory for the structure and
 * calling the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerInit method to give it a resource
 * to manage, and a method to free it when necessary.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * A handle to a resource can be fetched from a resource manager using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleIncUse method. This increments the "in use"
 * counter in a thread safe manor and returns an exclusive handle to the
 * resource.
 *
 * When getting a handle to a resource, if all the available handles are in use
 * then the method will block until one is available.
 *
 * ## Release
 *
 * Once a resource handle is finished with, it must be released back to the
 * resource manager using the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleDecUse method. This
 * releases the handle so it is available to other threads.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * A resource manager is freed, along with its resource, using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree method. This prevents any new handles
 * from being acquired, and frees the resource being managed.
 * If the resource has active handles, then a free method does not block.
 * Instead it prevents new handles from being acquired and sets the manager
 * to free the resource once the last handle has been released.
 *
 *
 * ## Replace
 *
 * A resource can be replaced using the #fiftyoneDegreesResourceReplace method.
 * This swaps the resource being managed so that any new requests for a handle
 * return the new resource. The existing resource is freed once the last active
 * handle to it has been released.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * typedef struct someResourceType {
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandle *handle; 
 *     void *data;
 * }
 * someResourceType *resource;
 * fiftyoneDegreesResourceManager manager;
 *
 * // Initialise the resource manager with a resource
 * fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerInit(
 *     &manager,
 *     resource,
 *     &resource->handle,
 *     Free);
 *
 * // Check that the resource handle was set successfully
 * if (resource->handle != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Get a handle to the resource to ensure it is not freed by any
 *     // other threads
 *     someResourceType *localResource = (someResourceType*)
 *         fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleIncUse(&manager)->resource;
 *
 *     // Free the resource. This operation will be postponed until there are
 *     // no remaining handled being used
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceManagerFree(&manager);
 *
 *     // Do something with the resource while it is guaranteed to be available
 *     // ...
 *
 *     // Release the resource so other threads know it is eligible for freeing
 *     fiftyoneDegreesResourceHandleDecUse(resource->handle);
 *
 *     // This is the point where the call to free the manager will actually
 *     // be carried out now that nothing is referencing the resource
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesProperties Properties
 *
 * Structures for properties which are available, or required.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Required Property Index** : the 0 based index of the property in the list
 * of required properties. Not the same as the property index.
 *
 * **Property Index** : the 0 based index of the property in the source used to 
 * create the required properties. Not the same as the required property index.
 *
 * **Results** : the structure used to contain the data associated with the 
 * available required properties.
 *
 * **Source** : the source of property names. Typically a call back method to
 * return properties from the data structure used by the aspect engine.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Aspect engine performance can often be improved by limiting the properties
 * that can be returned from the engine. As this is a performance feature 
 * shared across different types of aspect engine the utility functions are
 * stored in the common C files.
 *
 * Required properties could be specified at initialisation as a character 
 * separated string, as an array of strings or from an existing set of 
 * properties already obtained from these methods. In all scenarios it is 
 * desirable to be able to query the properties and find their indexes in the 
 * source data structure using a consistent set of methods.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesCreate is used to create a consistent set of 
 * required properties. The structure passed must have one of the follow set.
 *
 * 1. Separated string of property names. Valid separators include space,
 * comma and pipe.
 * 2. An array of strings.
 * 3. Existing properties results from a previous creation operation. This 
 * method is used when a data set is being reloaded due to a change in the 
 * underlying data.
 *
 * Creation also requires a method to retrieve the name of the properties from 
 * the underlying data source. A method pointer conforming to 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesGetMethod must be provided to retrieve the
 * property name string item for a given property index up to the maximum
 * count. The call back is used to avoid any hard dependency between the data
 * structure and the properties methods.
 *
 * Unlike standard collection item retrieval the properties methods will not 
 * know the underlying collection implement or reference from which the item 
 * was obtained from. Therefore the implementation of get MUST set the 
 * collection field of the collection item.
 *
 * Some, or all, of the required properties may not be present in the
 * underlying data source. Any missing properties will be ignored in the
 * results. The get  name from required index method can be used to iterate
 * over the available  properties. The number of available properties after
 * creation can be obtained  from the count field of properties results.
 *
 * Whilst the property names can be provided as string(s) the property names 
 * referenced from the properties results are collection items from a strings 
 * collection. The properties methods are responsible for releasing the 
 * references to these strings when the properties results are freed.
 *
 * The resulting require properties index will be in ascending order of the 
 * property name a string. As such the ordered list can be used with a binary 
 * search (divide and conquer) to quickly determine the required property index
 * from the property name.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * When the properties results are finished with, the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPropertiesFree method must be used. This will also free the 
 * collection items used to reference the property name strings using the 
 * collection field of the item to obtain the source collection. This
 * collection must have been set by the get method used at creation.
 *
 * ## Operation
 *
 * Several methods are available which can be used to convert from an input 
 * such as a property name or required property index to a property index in 
 * the data structure. The method names are self-explanatory.
 *
 * Where possible using integer property or required property indexes is 
 * preferable to the string representation of the property as this improves 
 * performance.

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesOverrides Overrides
 *
 * Used to override properties values or an entire profile.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Overrides are used to override property values, or an entire profile in a
 * set of results. For example, if the screen size is not known from the HTTP
 * headers alone, it can be fetched using JavaScript and overridden.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * An array of overridable properties is created using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverridePropertiesCreate method. This returns all the
 * properties which are capable of being overridden.
 *
 * An array of override value ready to be populated is created using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverrideValuesCreate method. This is then ready to be added
 * to and used to override the values in a results structure.
 *
 * ## Extraction
 *
 * Override values are extracted from an evidence structure using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverridesExtractFromEvidence method. This looks through the
 * items of evidence for any items which are overrides, then parses and adds
 * them to the override values ready to be applied.
 *
 * ## Add
 *
 * Override values can also be added using the #fiftyoneDegreesOverridesAdd or
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverrideValuesAdd methods which add a single or multiple 
 * values respectively to the override values.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * Property and value overrides are freed using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverridePropertiesFree and
 * #fiftyoneDegreesOverrideValuesFree methods.

/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesEvidence Evidence
 *
 * Contains key value pairs as evidence to be processed.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * An Evidence structure contains key value pairs to be parsed and processed
 * by an engine.
 *
 * Items of evidence (e.g. an HTTP header) are added to the structure. The
 * values are then parsed based on the key prefix. In the case of an HTTP
 * header the string would simply be copied, but other types can require
 * further parsing.
 * Evidence items can then be accessed by engines in their parsed form,
 * enabling simpler processing.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * An evidence structure is created using the #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceCreate
 * method. This takes the maximum number of evidence items which the structure
 * can store.
 *
 * ## Prefixes
 *
 * Evidence keys contain a prefix and the key within that prefix. For example,
 * the key `header.user-agent` has the prefix `header` indicating that the
 * second part of the key is an HTTP header name (`user-agent`).
 *
 * Prefixes are stored as an enum value with the type of
 * #fiftyoneDegreesEvidencePrefix. The enum value of the prefix can be found
 * for a key string by using the #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceMapPrefix method which
 * takes the key string as an argument, and returns the enum value.
 *
 * Prefix values are defined by their bit positions such that multiple prefixes
 * can be filtered when iterating with the #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceIterate
 * method. For example, to iterate over all HTTP headers and all query
 * parameters two prefixes can be used in combination like
 * `FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EVIDENCE_HTTP_HEADER_STRING | FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EVIDENCE_QUERY`.
 *
 * ## Add
 *
 * An item of evidence is added to the evidence structure using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceAddString method. This then parses the string value
 * it is provided into the correct type which is determined by the prefix.
 *
 * ## Iterate
 *
 * The evidence a particular evidence structure can be iterated over using the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceIterate method. This takes a prefix filter (as
 * described in the Prefixes section above), and a callback method which is
 * called for each evidence item which matches the filter. The number of
 * matching items is then returned.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * An evidence structure is freed using the #fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceFree
 * method. It is important to note that this method does **NOT** free the
 * original values which are referenced by the structure.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * void *state;
 * fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceIterateMethod doSomethingToAValue;
 *
 * // Create an evidence structure large enough to hold a single item of
 * // evidence
 * fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceKeyValuePairArray* evidence =
 *     fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceCreate(1);
 *
 * // Add an item of evidence which is a string
 * fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceAddString(
 *     evidence,
 *     fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceMapPrefix("header"),
 *     "some-header-name",
 *     "some-header-value");
 *
 * // Iterate over all HTTP header evidence and call a method which does
 * // something to each item
 * int numberIterated = fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceIterate(
 *     evidence,
 *     FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EVIDENCE_HTTP_HEADER_STRING,
 *     state,
 *     doSomethingToAValue);
 *
 * // Free the evidence
 * fiftyoneDegreesEvidenceFree(evidence);

 /**
  * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
  * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesIndices Indices
  *
  * A look up structure for profile and property index to the first value 
  * associated with the property and profile.
  *
  * ## Introduction
  * 
  * Data sets relate profiles to the values associated with them. Values are
  * associated with properties. The values associated with a profile are 
  * ordered in ascending order of property. Therefore when a request is made to
  * obtain the value for a property and profile the values needed to be 
  * searched using a binary search to find a value related to the property. 
  * Then the list of prior values is checked until the first value for the 
  * property is found.
  * 
  * The indices methods provide common functionality to create a structure
  * that directly relates profile ids and required property indexes to the 
  * first value index thus increasing the efficiency of retrieving values.
  * 
  * It is expected these methods will be used during data set initialization.
  * 
  * ## Structure
  * 
  * A sparse array of profile ids and required property indexes is used. Whilst
  * this consumes more linear memory than a binary tree or other structure it 
  * is extremely fast to retrieve values from. As the difference between the 
  * lowest and highest profile id is relatively small the memory associated 
  * with absent profile ids is considered justifiable considering the 
  * performance benefit. A further optimization is to use the required property
  * index rather than the index of all possible properties contained in the 
  * data set. In most use cases the caller only requires a sub set of 
  * properties to be available for retrieval.
  * 
  * ## Create
  * 
  * fiftyoneDegreesIndicesPropertyProfileCreate should be called once the data
  * set is initialized with the required data structures. Memory is allocated
  * by the method and a pointer to the index data structure is returned. The
  * caller is not expected to use the returned data structure directly.
  * 
  * Some working memory is allocated during the indexing process. Therefore 
  * this method must be called before a freeze on allocating new memory is
  * required.
  * 
  * ## Free
  * 
  * fiftyoneDegreesIndicesPropertyProfileFree is used to free the memory used
  * by the index returned from Create. Must be called during the freeing of the
  * related data set.
  * 
  * ## Lookup
  * 
  * fiftyoneDegreesIndicesPropertyProfileLookup is used to return the index in
  * the values associated with the profile for the profile id and the required
  * property index.

 * ## Get
 *
 * A property can be fetched from a properties collection in one of two ways:
 *
 * **By Index** : The #fiftyoneDegreesPropertyGet method return the property at
 * a specified index. This provides a way to access a property at a known
 * index, or iterate over all properties.
 *
 * **By Name** : If the index of a property is not known, then the property can
 * be fetched using the #fiftyoneDegreesPropertyGetByName method to find the
 * property in a properties collection.

 * A profiles collection can be iterated in two ways:
 *
 * **Values** : The #fiftyoneDegreesProfileIterateValuesForProperty method can
 * be used to iterate over all the values which a profile contains for a
 * specified property.
 *
 * **Profiles** : The #fiftyoneDegreesProfileIterateProfilesForPropertyAndValue
 * method can be used to iterate over all the profiles in a profiles collection
 * which contain a specified property and value pairing.

  * Contains common methods to create JSON documents, add properties, add 
  * either single or list values to properties. String values are escaped to
  * comply with the JSON specification.
  * 
  * ## Data Structures
  * 
  * A single data structure is used with members for a) the output buffer, and 
  * b) the reference data. 
  * 
  * The output buffer is represented as a pointer and a length. An additional
  * member is used to record the number of characters that would be needed to
  * complete the creation of a valid JSON response. This can be used by the 
  * caller to increase the buffer size if not big enough and call the related
  * methods a subsequent time. 
  * 
  * Reference data for the property being added, the values being added, and
  * a collection of strings is also provided.
  *

 * 
 * Evaluates an IP address and component id to determine the index associated 
 * with the profile or profile group from the related component.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphCreateFrom[Memory|File] should be used to create an
 * array of component graph information records from a suitable data source.
 * 
 * This array is past to the fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphEvaluate function along
 * with the IP address and the id of the component required. The following code
 * would be used to obtain the result for component id 1 and IP address 
 * 51.51.51.51.
 * 
 *	Exception exception;
 *	uint32_t result = 0;
 *	const char* ipAddress = "51.51.51.51";
 *	IpAddress parsedIpAddress;
 *	parsedIpAddress.type = 0;
 *	if (IpAddressParse(
 *		ipAddress,
 *		ipAddress + sizeof(ipAddress), 
 *		&parsedIpAddress)) {
 *		result = fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphEvaluate(
 *			wrapper->array,
 *			(byte)1,
 *			parsedIpAddress,	
 *			&exception);
 *	}
 * 
 * The IP address is parsed from a string into a IpAddress instance using the
 * common-cxx IP functions.
 * 
 * The array created must be freed with the fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphFree method
 * when finished with.
 * 
 * ## Note
 * 
 * The methods marked trace are for 51Degrees internal purposes and are not
 * intended for production usage.
 * 
 * Associated tests are not provided as open source. Contact 51Degrees if more
 * information is required.
